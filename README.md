When I was in high school, I dreamed about making a really awesome game. What game? Any game! FPS, Strategy, Puzzle, you name it all.

The curious boy that I was, then started investigating on what required to make games. Well, duh, of course: a game engine! Also programming!

People on forums said that the best language was C++ to do everything. Yes I asked that, sorry :innocent:! Therefore, I started my own game engine.

This is only a part of that game engine.


Notes
=====

* Shiny SSE (Streamlined SIMD Extensions) compiler intrinsics being used here. Ninja coding at its best.

* I cannot give documentation much, It's been years since I last saw this.

* This is the `Lib` folder of my game engine that I shared with some friends and I can't find the rest of the project. Too bad back then I did not know how `git` worked :disappointed:.
